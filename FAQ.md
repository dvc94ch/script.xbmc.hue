"Use all lights" doesn't work for me
------------------------------------

If the add-on is configured to "Use all lights", bulb number 2 has a 
special function. This bulb is "leading", ie the settings from this 
bulb are used for the whole group. Make sure this light is turned on 
when you start XBMC. If not, the add-on thinks the complete group is 
turned off.
